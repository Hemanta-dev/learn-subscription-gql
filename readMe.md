# GraphQL Server Setup

This repository contains code for setting up a GraphQL server using Express, Apollo Server, and WebSockets for subscriptions.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```sh
   cd <project_directory>
   ```

3. Install the required packages using yarn:

   ```sh
   yarn add express http @graphql-tools/schema subscriptions-transport-ws graphql apollo-server-express apollo-server-core
   ```

   This command will install the necessary packages for your GraphQL server, including Express, HTTP, GraphQL Tools, Subscriptions-Transport-WS, GraphQL, Apollo Server Express, and Apollo Server Core.

## Configuration

1. Database Connection:

   - The code assumes that the database connection is managed in the `./model/DB.js` file. Make sure to provide the correct configuration for your database in this file.

2. GraphQL Schema and Resolvers:

   - Define your GraphQL type definitions in the `./typeDefs.js` file.
   - Implement your GraphQL resolvers in the `./resolvers.js` file.

## Running the Server

1. Start the server:

   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

   The server will start and listen on port 5000.

2. Access GraphQL Playground:

   Once the server is running, you can access the GraphQL Playground by opening your web browser and navigating to:

   ```
   http://localhost:5000/graphql
   ```

   This will open the GraphQL Playground, where you can test your queries, mutations, and subscriptions.

## Provided Code

Below is the provided code snippet that sets up the GraphQL server using Apollo Server, Express, and WebSockets for subscriptions:

```javascript
// Import required libraries
import express from "express";
import { createServer } from "http";
import { makeExecutableSchema } from "@graphql-tools/schema";
import { SubscriptionServer } from "subscriptions-transport-ws";
import { execute, subscribe } from "graphql";
import { ApolloServer } from "apollo-server-express";
import { ApolloServerPluginLandingPageGraphQLPlayground } from "apollo-server-core";
import connectToDatabase from "./model/DB.js";
import typeDefs from "./typeDefs.js";
import resolvers from "./resolvers.js";

// Create an Express app and HTTP server
const app = express();
const httpServer = createServer(app);

// Create a GraphQL schema from type definitions and resolvers
const schema = makeExecutableSchema({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
});

// Create a SubscriptionServer for real-time updates
const subscriptionServerInstance = SubscriptionServer.create(
  { schema, execute, subscribe },
  { server: httpServer, path: "/graphql" }
);

// Create an Apollo Server instance
const server = new ApolloServer({
  schema,
  plugins: [
    {
      async serverWillStart() {
        return {
          async drainServer() {
            subscriptionServerInstance.close();
          },
        };
      },
    },
    ApolloServerPluginLandingPageGraphQLPlayground(),
  ],
});

// Establish a database connection
connectToDatabase();

// Start the Apollo Server and apply Express middleware
(async function () {
  await server.start();
  server.applyMiddleware({ app });

  // Start the HTTP server
  const PORT = 5000;
  httpServer.listen(PORT, () => {
    console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);
  });
})();
```

- Import necessary libraries to set up the server.
- Create an Express app and an HTTP server.
- Define the GraphQL schema using type definitions and resolvers.
- Create a SubscriptionServer instance for real-time updates using WebSockets.
- Set up an Apollo Server instance with custom plugins, including GraphQL Playground.
- Establish a connection to the database using the `connectToDatabase` function.
- Start the Apollo Server and apply Express middleware.
- Start the HTTP server to listen on port 5000.

- The server is set up to use the Apollo Server landing page and GraphQL Playground for easier testing and visualization of your GraphQL schema.

- The server uses WebSockets for subscriptions, allowing real-time data updates.

- Make sure to configure your database connection properly in the `./model/DB.js` file.

- You can modify the schema, resolvers, and other components according to your project requirements.
