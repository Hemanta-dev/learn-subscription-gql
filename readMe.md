# GraphQL Server Setup

This repository contains code for setting up a GraphQL server using Express, Apollo Server, and WebSockets for subscriptions.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```sh
   cd <project_directory>
   ```

3. Install the required packages using yarn:

   ```sh
   yarn add express http @graphql-tools/schema subscriptions-transport-ws graphql apollo-server-express apollo-server-core
   ```

   This command will install the necessary packages for your GraphQL server, including Express, HTTP, GraphQL Tools, Subscriptions-Transport-WS, GraphQL, Apollo Server Express, and Apollo Server Core.

## Configuration

1. Database Connection:

   - The code assumes that the database connection is managed in the `./model/DB.js` file. Make sure to provide the correct configuration for your database in this file.

2. GraphQL Schema and Resolvers:

   - Define your GraphQL type definitions in the `./typeDefs.js` file.
   - Implement your GraphQL resolvers in the `./resolvers.js` file.

## Running the Server

1. Start the server:

   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

   The server will start and listen on port 5000.

2. Access GraphQL Playground:

   Once the server is running, you can access the GraphQL Playground by opening your web browser and navigating to:

   ```
   http://localhost:5000/graphql
   ```

   This will open the GraphQL Playground, where you can test your queries, mutations, and subscriptions.

## Provided Code

Below is the provided code snippet that sets up the GraphQL server using Apollo Server, Express, and WebSockets for subscriptions:

```javascript
// Import required libraries
import express from "express";
import { createServer } from "http";
import { makeExecutableSchema } from "@graphql-tools/schema";
import { SubscriptionServer } from "subscriptions-transport-ws";
import { execute, subscribe } from "graphql";
import { ApolloServer } from "apollo-server-express";
import { ApolloServerPluginLandingPageGraphQLPlayground } from "apollo-server-core";
import connectToDatabase from "./model/DB.js";
import typeDefs from "./typeDefs.js";
import resolvers from "./resolvers.js";

// Create an Express app and HTTP server
const app = express();
const httpServer = createServer(app);

// Create a GraphQL schema from type definitions and resolvers
const schema = makeExecutableSchema({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
});

// Create a SubscriptionServer for real-time updates
const subscriptionServerInstance = SubscriptionServer.create(
  { schema, execute, subscribe },
  { server: httpServer, path: "/graphql" }
);

// Create an Apollo Server instance
const server = new ApolloServer({
  schema,
  plugins: [
    {
      async serverWillStart() {
        return {
          async drainServer() {
            subscriptionServerInstance.close();
          },
        };
      },
    },
    ApolloServerPluginLandingPageGraphQLPlayground(),
  ],
});

// Establish a database connection
connectToDatabase();

// Start the Apollo Server and apply Express middleware
(async function () {
  await server.start();
  server.applyMiddleware({ app });

  // Start the HTTP server
  const PORT = 5000;
  httpServer.listen(PORT, () => {
    console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);
  });
})();
```

- Import necessary libraries to set up the server.
- Create an Express app and an HTTP server.
- Define the GraphQL schema using type definitions and resolvers.
- Create a SubscriptionServer instance for real-time updates using WebSockets.
- Set up an Apollo Server instance with custom plugins, including GraphQL Playground.
- Establish a connection to the database using the `connectToDatabase` function.
- Start the Apollo Server and apply Express middleware.
- Start the HTTP server to listen on port 5000.

- The server is set up to use the Apollo Server landing page and GraphQL Playground for easier testing and visualization of your GraphQL schema.

- The server uses WebSockets for subscriptions, allowing real-time data updates.

- Make sure to configure your database connection properly in the `./model/DB.js` file.

- You can modify the schema, resolvers, and other components according to your project requirements.

### GraphQL Server Setup

1. Import necessary modules and packages.

2. Create an instance of the `express` application framework to handle HTTP requests.

3. Use the built-in `http` module's `createServer` function to create an HTTP server using the `express` app.

4. Utilize the `makeExecutableSchema` function from the `@graphql-tools/schema` package to create a GraphQL schema by combining `typeDefs` (type definitions) and `resolvers` (field resolvers).

5. Import and use the `SubscriptionServer` class from `subscriptions-transport-ws` to set up a WebSocket-based server for handling GraphQL subscriptions.

6. Import the `execute` and `subscribe` functions from the `graphql` package. These functions are used to execute and subscribe to GraphQL queries and mutations.

7. Create an instance of the `ApolloServer` class from the `apollo-server-express` package, passing in the previously created schema. This will be our main GraphQL server.

8. Add plugins to the Apollo Server configuration:
   - A plugin to ensure the proper closing of the subscription server instance during shutdown.
   - The `ApolloServerPluginLandingPageGraphQLPlayground` plugin to enable the GraphQL Playground UI.

9. Connect to the database using the custom `connectToDatabase` function. This function likely establishes a connection to your chosen database system.

10. Start the Apollo Server asynchronously by calling `server.start()`. This initializes the server and prepares it to handle incoming GraphQL requests.

11. Apply the Apollo Server middleware to the `express` app using the `applyMiddleware` method. This integrates the GraphQL server with the Express application.

12. Define a constant `PORT` with the desired port number, e.g., 5000.

13. Start the HTTP server by calling the `listen` method on the `httpServer` instance. This makes the server listen on the specified port and outputs a log message confirming the server's running status.

14. The entire code is wrapped in an Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) to ensure it executes when the file is loaded.

By following these steps, you'll set up a comprehensive GraphQL server using Express, complete with subscription capabilities, integrated database connectivity, and a user-friendly GraphQL Playground UI.
